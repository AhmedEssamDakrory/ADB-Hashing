#### 1) To run the chaining technique:
- First compile using the command " g++ -o run chainingMain.cpp readfile.cpp chaining.h readfile.h
"
- Then run using the command "./run".
- You will be asked to enter the filename of the testcase you want to run (you can find an example in the file "test1.txt") 
#### 2) To run the openAddressing technique:
- First compile using the command " g++ -o run openAddressingMain.cpp readfile.cpp openAddressing.h readfile.h
"
- Then run using the command "./run".
- You will be asked to enter the filename of the testcase you want to run (you can find an example in the file "test1.txt")
